## About Me

Hi! My name is Zachary Mueller, and I'm a rising senior (2021) at the University of West Florida. I'm majoring in **Software Design and Development** and I have minors in both **Computer Science** and **Environmental Science**. I am also currently a Deep Learning Software Engineer at Novetta (yes, that is indeed school and work at the same time)

I have a heavy passion for Deep Learning and Open Source libraries. As a result, below you will find some notable articles I've written, a few courses I've made, some of software libraries I've written, interesting projects, and the open source libraries I have tried to contribute the most to.

## Noteable Articles and Posts

- [Methods for Automating Learning Rate Finders (March 2021)](https://www.novetta.com/2021/03/learning-rate/)

- [lib2nbdev (June 2021)](https://www.novetta.com/2021/06/lib2nbdev/)

- [PyTorch to fastai, Bridging the Gap (February 2021)](https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2021/02/14/Pytorchtofastai.html)

- [Zero to Hero with `fastai`](https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/21/beginner.html)

- [Capstone Project - Revisiting IMDB](https://muellerzr.github.io/NLP-Capstone/)

- [Suspecto - Analyzing News Articles with Natural Language Processing to Score Credibility](https://muellerzr.github.io/Suspecto/)

## Courses

- [Walk with fastai](https://walkwithfastai.com)
> Walk with fastai was the second iteration of my exploration with courses. In it I taught over 10 lessons on the new fastai API, exploring new avenues that the API could preform and displaying unique situations often not covered within the orignal course. So far it has been wildly successful, with many of the lectures garnishing over a thousand views on YouTube

- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders)
> This was a rehash of the fastai course of the same name that I taught at the University of West Florida through the Artificial Intellegence Research Group in 2019


## Open Source Software Libraries

- [AdaptNLP](https://novetta.github.io/adaptnlp)
> While at Novetta, I have been the lead developer for the AdaptNLP library. This library wraps the HuggingFace Transformers and fastai libraries into an easy-to-use interface for both fine-tuning and performing inference with transformer-based models. It was featured in the Weights and Biases [HuggingFace Study Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9DtxwUTtI)

- [lib2nbdev](https://novetta.github.io/lib2nbdev)
> Seeing a need to ease integration of the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) framework into more projects, I built lib2nbdev as a single-use library that will convert existing python projects into a compatible nbdev library. 

- [wwf](https://walkwithfastai)
> Along with being a course, the Walk with fastai library (wwf) is also a conglomerate of useful documentation and code for fastai applications centralized in a single location

- [nbverbose](https://muellerzr.github.io/nbverbose)
> nbverbose aims at combining both the one-line documentation style that fastai incentivizes without losing best practices nor documentation accessability. By combining the fastcore library with nbdev, this library provides an efficient way to document your code while minimizing the vertical space needed to get there

- [fastinference](https://muellerzr.github.io/fastinference)
> The fastinference library was designed around making inference with the fastai library simpler, faster, and more approachable. This entailed providing ONNX exportability as well as in-house interpretability modules

- [fastdebug](https://muellerzr.github.io/fastdebug)
> Aimed at easing the annoyance of common bugs, this library helps users of both the PyTorch and fastai ecosystems provide clear debugging logs when it comes to extremely common exceptions that get thrown that could use a little touch-up

- [fastshap](https://github.com/muellerzr/fastshap)
> The fastshap library brought in SHAP into the fastai framework. It has since been merged with the fastinference module, though one compatible with fastai version 1 is available on pypi

## Open Source Contributions

Most of my software contributions are within the fastai framework, prividing both major and minor bug fixes along the way.
