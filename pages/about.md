I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of West Florida, with a graduation date of Spring 2021. Afterwards, I plan on going to Graduate School to get my Master's Degree in Data Science

At the University I facilitate and teach the Fast.AI classes to Undergraduates and Graduates, with Jeremy's notes being my forefront go-to. Currently, the Practical Deep Learning course is happening, with plans to slowly integrate more to help teach students the benefits of knowing Deep Learning in the modern world.
